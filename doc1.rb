# 1. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 0 if the number is equal to 10, and prints -1 otherwise.

# x = 93
# if x == 25
#   p 0
# else 
#   p -1
# end

# 2. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints -1 if the number is less than 10, prints 1 if the number is greater than 10, and prints 0 if the number is equal to 10.

# x = 8
# if x < 10 
#   p -1
# elsif x > 10 
#   p 1
# elsif x == 10
#   p 0
# end 

# 10. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 5 if the number is greater than 80, prints 4 if the number is greater than 60, prints 3 if the number is greater than 40, prints 2 if the number is greater than 20, and prints 1 otherwise (only one print statement should occur).

# x = 40
# if x > 80 
#   p 5
# elsif x > 60 && x < 80
#   p 4
# elsif x > 40 && x < 60
#   p 3
# elsif x > 20 && x < 40
#   p 2
# else
#   p 1
# end

# 5. Make an array of hashes to store the title and author for 3 different books. Then print out the third book's author.
# books = [{title: "Harry Potter", author: "JK Rowling"}, {title: "Count of Monte Cristo", author: "Alexander Dumas"}, {title: "Wild", author: "Cheryl Strayed"}]

# p books[2][:author]

# 9. Make a hash to store definitions for 2 different words. Then add a new word and definition and print the hash to see the result.
# words = {"entice" => "attract or tempt", "confound" => "cause surprise" }

# words["erogenous"] = "sensitive"

# p words

# 7. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints the number of letters in the word.
# puts "Enter a word"
# word = gets.chomp
# x = word.length
# puts x


# 10. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints "That's a long word" if the word has more than 5 letters.
# puts "Enter a word"
# word = gets.chomp
# if word.length > 5 
#   p "That's a long word"
# elsif 
#   p word
# end 

#  2. Use a nested loop with two arrays of strings to create a new array of strings with each string combined.
#     For example, ["a", "b", "c"] and ["d", "e", "f", "g"] becomes ["ad", "ae", "af", "ag", "bd", "be", "bf", "bg"
loop1 = ["a", "b", "c"]
loop2 = ["d", "e", "f", "g"]
loop3 = []
x = 0 
while x < loop1.length
